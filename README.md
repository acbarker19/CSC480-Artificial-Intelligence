# CSC480: Artificial Intelligence
A repository containing projects created in my artificial intelligence class (CSC 480) at the University of Mount Union that was taught by Dr. James Klayder.

## How to Run
Run `src/AI_Basic/MainFrame.java`.

Select an example problem from the drop-down menu or write your own problem in the text area for the following:
- Missionaries and Cannibals
- 8 Puzzle
- Route Finder (smallest number of steps between cities)

Alternatively, check the `Tic-Tac-Toe` option on the right side of the window to play Tic-Tac-Toe. From there, you may select your moves from the drop-down menu on the right side of the window.

If you wish to attempt solving propositional logic sentences, run `src/AI_Basic/Resolution.java`. The resolutions will appear in the console. This feature is incomplete.

## Completed Features
- A breadth-first search that solves the following:
    - [Missionaries and Cannibals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem)
    - 8 Puzzle (a smaller version of the [15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle))
    - Route Finder (smallest number of steps between cities)
- Example data for each of the above problems
- Basic code for a game of Tic-Tac-Toe
- A GUI for the above features

## Incomplete Features
- Route Finder (shortest distance between cities)
- Fully functioning adversarial search for a game of Tic-Tac-Toe
- Performing resolutions on propositional logic sentences
